# get_next_line

# Project Overview üí°

This project involves developing a program that performs operations on files, such as reading, writing, and manipulating data stored within them. It focuses on utilizing file handling functions in C to interact with files and handle various file-related tasks.

# We use techniques like ‚úç :

- File operations : You'll learn how to perform operations on files, such as opening, reading, writing, and closing files.

- File manipulation : manipulating files, such as renaming, deleting, or checking file existence.
  
- File pointers : You'll work with file pointers, which are used to navigate and manipulate files. 

- Reading user input : You will learn how to create functions like " get_next_line() " to read or write data line by line.

- Character arrays : You will work with character arrays (char arrays) to store and manipulate strings of characters.

- Memory management : You will become familiar with allocating and managing memory for character arrays to store the lines of text.
   
- String manipulation : You may learn various string manipulation techniques, such as searching for specific patterns or characters, extracting substrings, or modifying strings.

- Error handling.

# Skills obtained üèÖ :
- Problem-solving and critical thinking
- File security and permissions
- Efficient data processing
